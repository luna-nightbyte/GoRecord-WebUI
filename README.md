# GoRecordurbate

## Intro
A golang version of recordurbate with some differences. One key difference is that this doesent use a deamon. It can instead be compiled into a binary file and started as a service, docker container or whatever you prefer. 

### Notes
This is un-tested on Windows and Mac, but golang is cross-compatible which means that this should run just as fine on Windows as on Linux.
